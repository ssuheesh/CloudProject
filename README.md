| 1. Develop an Auth application with the following                   Features                                                                                                                                                                          
| * SignUp: Users can use this feature to register an account which contains email (as ID), password, name, profileImage.                                                                                                                                                                 |    
| * Login: After registering successfully, users can login to the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
| * Upload image: After logging in successfully, users can upload their profile images. Users also can preview image. And the profile image is updated, they can see the profile image.

| * Front End: ReactJS, Angular, or any frontend frameworks you prefer.                                                        
| * Backend: Your preferred backend technology, such as NodeJS, Python, or Java.  
| * Front End: ReactJS, Angular, or any frontend frameworks you prefer.                                                        
|3. Deployment: Serverless architecture
|* Frontend: S3, CloudFront
|* Backend: Lambda, API gateway
|* Database: DynamoDB
|4. Implment CloudFormation template (YAML or CDK) for the above resources.
|5. Implement CodePipeline for Frontend or Backend
|6. Add the above CodePipeline to to the template.
